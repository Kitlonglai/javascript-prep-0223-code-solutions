## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
Determines the amount of times the loop should run and if it will run or not.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
At the beginning, before the execution of the code block.
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
After the initialization expression executes.
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
At the end, when both the initialization and condition expressions are executed along with the code block.
- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
The purpose is to the either increment or decrement the initial variable, which would eventually end the loop when it reaches the count of the conditional expression.
- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
The data type it is used on are numbers to count the number of iterations a loop will run.
